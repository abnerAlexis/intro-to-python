1. Create a structure named `recipe_1` that contains the following keys:  

`name (str)`: Contains the name of the recipe
`cooking_time (int)`: Contains the cooking time in minutes
`ingredients (list)`: Contains a number of ingredients, each of the `str` data type  

Decide what data structure you would use for this purpose, and in your README file in the repository for this task, describe in approx. 50-75 words why youâ€™ve chosen to use it.

I decided to use nested Dictionary structor.
* A dictionary's key-value pairs are ideal for representing recipe structures.   
* They allow easy manipulation, enabling the addition, removal, and modification of recipes and ingredients without restructuring.  
* Additionally, accessing a specific recipe is quick and efficient, making dictionaries a highly suitable data structure for managing and retrieving recipe information.
