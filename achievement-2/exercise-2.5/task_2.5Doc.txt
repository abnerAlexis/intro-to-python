Updates to models.py

I have updated recipes/models.py to include a new pic field. 
Adding this visual element enhances the application's interface 
and significantly improves the overall user experience by providing 
a richer, more engaging presentation.


Frontend inspirations
Since the day I started my CF journey Iâ€™ve been actively engaging
 with the materials recommended by my tutors and mentors. This has 
 been incredibly helpful in completing my tasks. For this project, 
 I applied my understanding of color harmony and made sure to utilize 
 white space effectively in the right areas to create a clean and 
 organized layout.
