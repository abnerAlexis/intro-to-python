Q - Take some time to think of what you want users to search for, the criterion 
for search, and format of output.

A - I've made significant progress on my recipe app by successfully implementing 
several key features. One of the highlights is a robust search functionality that 
allows users to find recipes by ingredient. After clicking the 'Search' button, a 
table displaying the relevant recipes is generated, along with a data analysis 
feature that visualizes the results using a chart of the user's choice.

In addition, I’ve developed a user registration feature, enabling new users to 
sign up and access the app's full range of capabilities. Despite the challenges, 
these accomplishments mark a major step forward in the app's development.

Q - Think of the user’s journey from the moment they land on the homepage, 
considering all the different navigation possibilities and search options.
For example, a user lands on the homepage, logs in to the account, searches 
for a recipe based on a recent date, sees the plots, checks details, and 
then logs out. Represent this journey as a flow chart.

A - Execution Flow:
The user arrives at the homepage.
The user selects either the 'Login' or 'Register' option.
If logging in, the user enters their username and password. If registering, 
they provide their username, email, password, and confirm the password.
Upon successful authentication or registration, the user is directed to the 
recipe list.
The user clicks on a specific recipe to view its details.
After reviewing the recipe, the user returns to the recipe list.
The user navigates to the search feature.
The user searches for recipes by entering an ingredient.
The user is presented with a table of recipes that match the entered ingredient and can view the selected charts.
Finally, the user logs out.

Q - At least one visualization using a bar, pie, and line chart (at least one for each). For each of the scenarios, identify the x- and y- axes and labels (if any). Also determine if you want charts to be displayed based on user input or simply to provide them at your own discretion.
A - Search by Ingredient
Data Analysis
The charts will be dynamically updated based on the currently searched ingredient:

Bar Graph

Visualizes the most popular ingredients.
X-Axis: Ingredients
Y-Axis: Count of how many times each ingredient appears in recipes
Pie Chart

Displays the percentage contribution of each ingredient to the total recipes found.
Each segment represents the proportion of recipes that include the respective ingredient.
Line Chart

Tracks the frequency of each ingredient's appearance in recipes over time.
X-Axis: Ingredients
Y-Axis: Count of how many times each ingredient appears in recipes
